     * (because existing ones died since last checking) or that
     * the pool shut down since entry into this method. So we
     * recheck state and if necessary roll back the enqueuing if
     * stopped, or start a new thread if there are none.
     *
     * 3. If we cannot queue task, then we try to add a new
     * thread.  If it fails, we know we are shut down or saturated
     * and so reject the task.

addWaiter

/*
 * Methods for creating, running and cleaning up after workers
 */

/**
 * Checks if a new worker can be added with respect to current
 * pool state and the given bound (either core or maximum). If so,
 * the worker count is adjusted accordingly, and, if possible, a
 * new worker is created and started, running firstTask as its
 * first task. This method returns false if the pool is stopped or
 * eligible to shut down. It also returns false if the thread
 * factory fails to create a thread when asked.  If the thread
 * creation fails, either due to the thread factory returning
 * null, or due to an exception (typically OutOfMemoryError in
 * Thread.start()), we roll back cleanly.
 *
 * @param firstTask the task the new thread should run first (or
 * null if none). Workers are created with an initial first task
 * (in method execute()) to bypass queuing when there are fewer
 * than corePoolSize threads (in which case we always start one),
 * or when the queue is full (in which case we must bypass queue).
 * Initially idle threads are usually created via
 * prestartCoreThread or to replace other dying workers.
 *
 * @param core if true use corePoolSize as bound, else
 * maximumPoolSize. (A boolean indicator is used here rather than a
 * value to ensure reads of fresh values after checking other pool
 * state).
 * @return true if successful

        // Check if queue empty only if necessary.
        首先状态检查，当运行状态非running时，如果是stop，tidying，terminated直接返回false
       	如果是shutdown状态（rs=0），
       		（1）如果firstTask不为空，返回false
       		（2）如果工作线程为空，返回false
       		（3）如果firstTask为空，workqueue不为空，添加worker。这里说明有任务被添加到阻塞队列中
        if (rs >= SHUTDOWN &&
            ! (rs == SHUTDOWN &&
               firstTask == null &&

            return false;
				
        for (;;) {

            如果工作线程操作最大线程，或者对应的上限则不能添加工作线程
            if (wc >= CAPACITY ||
                wc >= (core ? corePoolSize : maximumPoolSize))
                return false;
            添加成功跳出无限循环
            if (compareAndIncrementWorkerCount(c))
                break retry;
           	添加线程不成功，需要重新读取，并且如果rs发生变化，需要跳出内层循环重新判断状态，否则不跳出内存循环继续添加工作线程
            c = ctl.get();  // Re-read ctl
            if (runStateOf(c) != rs) 
                continue retry;

		完成状态判断和工作线程数修改，下面开始添加工作线程
    boolean workerStarted = false;
    boolean workerAdded = false;
    Worker w = null;
    try {
        w = new Worker(firstTask);
        final Thread t = w.thread;
        添加工作线程都需要全局锁
        if (t != null) {
            final ReentrantLock mainLock = this.mainLock;
            mainLock.lock();
            try {
                // Recheck while holding lock.
                // Back out on ThreadFactory failure or if
                // shut down before lock acquired.
                int rs = runStateOf(ctl.get());
								如果处于running，或者shutdown且第一个任务为空（阻塞队列中有任务）
                if (rs < SHUTDOWN ||
                    (rs == SHUTDOWN && firstTask == null)) {
                    if (t.isAlive()) // precheck that t is startable
                        throw new IllegalThreadStateException();
                    workers.add(w);
                    int s = workers.size();
                    if (s > largestPoolSize)
                        largestPoolSize = s;
                    workerAdded = true;
                }
            } finally {
                mainLock.unlock();
            }
            添加成功后启动线程
            if (workerAdded) {
                t.start();
                workerStarted = true;
            }
        }
    } finally {
        if (! workerStarted)
            addWorkerFailed(w);
    }
    return workerStarted;
}
```

addWorkerFailed()

```
/**
 * Rolls back the worker thread creation.
 * - removes worker from workers, if present
 * - decrements worker count
 * - rechecks for termination, in case the existence of this
 *   worker was holding up termination
 */
添加工作线程失败，需要回滚，从hashset移除worker，数量减一，并且尝试结束
private void addWorkerFailed(Worker w) {
    final ReentrantLock mainLock = this.mainLock;
    mainLock.lock();
    try {
        if (w != null)
            workers.remove(w);
        decrementWorkerCount();
        tryTerminate();
    } finally {
        mainLock.unlock();
    }
}
